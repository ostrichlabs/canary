Project Canary

It's a game engine. In theory.

In practice it's a learning exercise on writing a multiplatform game engine in C++ from scratch. If it doesn't work out, then I know I'm probably not cut out for such things. Hence, "canary."

- OpenGL 4/ES 2.0 for rendering
- OpenAL sound
- Supports Windows, Linux, Raspberry Pi

Initial projects will be simple, the first being a minesweeper clone. Future projects using canary will be more complex as I learn more about how these things work.
